### v0.5 (WIP)

Added `inline code` support, fixed the way *italics* and **bold** were detected (at least one character between separators).

Fixed a bug where itemized environments were terminated within a header tag if they were on consecutive lines.

### v0.4 (22 July 2018)

Added language, margin and table of contents options.
Manages font encoding in foreign languages.

Tables now use double lines after header and single lines on rows, more in line with the way markdown renderers usually work.

Added title, author and package options.

### v0.2 (22 June 2017)

Support for tables added.
